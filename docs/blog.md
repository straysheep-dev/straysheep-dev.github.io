# :material-book-open-page-variant-outline: Blog is now Notes


**If you landed here, you're likely looking for a page in the [notes](./notes/about.md) tab.**

!!! note "Optional Redirect"

    The blog has since been restructured to be more like documentation, but that's all that's changed. It's still updated regularly with all the same content as before.

    The new search capabilities (`Ctrl+K`) of Zensical should help you find what you're looking for.

!!! tip "The Resources Tab"

    The previous :star: Resources post is also now its own tab.

    Navigate over to the [resources](../resources.md) tab if you're just looking for external references in general.
