# Ansible

Getting started with Ansible. If you don't know what Ansible is or what it's used for:

!!! quote "What is Ansible?"

	Ansible is a radically simple IT automation platform that makes your applications and systems easier to deploy and maintain. Automate everything from code deployment to network configuration to cloud management, in a language that approaches plain English, using SSH, with no agents to install on remote systems. <https://docs.ansible.com>.

!!! note "About this Post"

	This post is a mirror of [straysheep-dev/ansible-configs](https://github.com/straysheep-dev/ansible-configs)'s README. It's being added here as both, a searchable reference within this mkdocs site, and because the recent post on [Molecule](../posts/ansible-molecule.md) needed to be split off into it's own post due to the amount of examples and details. This may end up being the primary source to maintain these notes going forward, with the ansible-configs project README linking back to this post.

## Example Project: ansible-configs

The [ansible-conifgs](https://github.com/straysheep-dev/ansible-configs) project is a monorepo of every Ansible role I've created or forked for my own use. Since this post was originally just the README for that project, you can use it to follow along below and get started in a test VM to learn about Ansible. The only reason this might be useful to anyone getting started is because when the monorepo was created, I was also just getting started. A lot of the notes here and roles were created from that perspective.

!!! example "[ansible-conifgs](https://github.com/straysheep-dev/ansible-configs)"

	A collection of ansible roles.

	This repo is both a set of various roles to mirror my own bash scripts, and my notes on using Ansible for easy reference.

	It's structured to be easy to clone, modify, and run only the roles you need. In most cases all you need to change is:

	- `playbook.yml`'s roles
	- Your preferred `inventory/` file's hosts + users

	Use whichever inventory format works best for you. The `.ini` files allow specifying users as inline variables per host, which is useful if each host in a group has different users you'll be connecting as.

	Each inventory example connects to the ansible controller (the localhost of the machine you're running ansible from) by default. Modify these files to add your own remote connections.

	When you're done, run the playbook with one of the following:

	```bash
	# For using sudo on the remote host, where you aren't using the root account
	ansible-playbook -i inventory/inventory.ini [-b] --ask-become-pass -v playbook.yml

	# For using the root account on the remote host, typically to deploy and provision cloud resources
	ansible-playbook -i inventory/inventory.ini -v playbook.yml
	```

	- `-b` will automatically elevate all tasks so you don't need to specify "become sudo" across every task (don't do this unless you need to)
	- `--ask-become-pass` takes the sudo password for the remote user
	- `-v` will show a useful amount of information without being too verbose

	To do: how to specify each remote user's password (if there are multiple remote users listed, each with a unique password).


## Setup

Install Ansible:

- [Install Ansible via pipx](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#installing-and-upgrading-ansible-with-pipx)
- [pipx: Install](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/#install-pipx)
- [Install Ansible via pip](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#ensuring-pip-is-available)
- [Ensure pip, setuptools, wheel are up to date](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/#ensure-pip-setuptools-and-wheel-are-up-to-date)
- [Install pip on Debian/Ubuntu](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-linux-tools/#debian-ubuntu-and-derivatives)


### Ubuntu 23.10+, Fedora:

It's recommended to use `pipx`.

```bash
# Ubuntu
sudo apt update
sudo apt install pipx

# Fedora
sudo dnf install pipx

pipx ensurepath
sudo pipx ensurepath --global # optional to allow pipx actions with --global argument
```

Install Ansible using pipx:

```bash
pipx install --include-deps ansible
```

[Inject additional libraries with pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx?tab=readme-ov-file#inject-a-package), like `passlib` to generate Unix password hashes:

```bash
pipx inject ansible passlib
```

Upgrade Ansible:

```bash
pipx upgrade --include-injected ansible
```


### Ubuntu 22.04 and Older

If you're missing `pip`, the recommended way to install it on Ubuntu, or other Debian derivitives is through apt (Ansible's documentation also mentions the `python3-pip` package):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

Install Ansible using pip:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user ansible
```

Upgrade Ansible:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade --user ansible
```


### Install Multiple Versions

See: [Ansible Community Changelogs](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/release_and_maintenance.html#ansible-community-changelogs)

Using [pipx you can install multiple versions of packages side by side](https://github.com/pypa/pipx/pull/445). This is useful when you want the latest version of a package, and also a specific version of a package on the same system for testing.

To install all of the `ansible-` tools, [you need to specify `ansible-core`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#pipx-install).

```bash
version_number="1.2.3"
package_name='ansible-lint' # or ansible-core
pipx install --suffix=_"$version_number" "$package_name"=="$version_number"
```

Call the version-pinned installation using the suffix:

```bash
ansible-lint_1.2.3 --version # If installing ansible-lint==1.2.3
ansible-playbook_1.2.3 --version  # If installing ansible-core==1.2.3
```

Remove any versions you may have installed through `pipx` by following the steps above for testing:

```bash
version_number="2.12.10"
package_name='ansible-core' # or ansible-core
pipx uninstall "$package_name"_"$version_number"
```


#### Older Systems

The latest versions of Ansible will not execute on systems with older versions of python3 installed. You will see an error similar to this, where it isn't even able to print the required version information:

```bash
fatal: [10.10.10.55]: FAILED! => {"ansible_facts": {}, "changed": false, "failed_modules": {"ansible.legacy.setup": {"ansible_facts": {"discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"}, "exception": "Traceback (most recent call last):

<SNIP>

  File \"/tmp/ansible_ansible.legacy.setup_payload_zlebszdb/ansible_ansible.legacy.setup_payload.zip/ansible/module_utils/basic.py\", line 17
    msg=f\"ansible-core requires a minimum of Python version {'.'.join(map(str, _PY_MIN))}. Current version: {''.join(sys.version.splitlines())}\",

```

!!! tip "Ansible 2.13.0"

	The versions found to be the most successful for these use cases are Ansible 2.13.0 or above.


### Better CLI Output

By default, Ansible will write output from playbooks and tasks without newlines interpretted. This makes reading playbooks executed with `-v` difficult.

- [jeffgeerling.com: Ansible YAML Callback Plugin for a Better CLI Experience](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2018/use-ansibles-yaml-callback-plugin-better-cli-experience)
- [Ansible: Setting a Callback Plugin](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/callback.html#setting-a-callback-plugin-for-ansible-playbook)
- [`ansible-doc -t callback -l`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/callback.html#plugin-list)
- [Ansible: ansible.builtin.default Now Supports YAML](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/general/yaml_callback.html#deprecated)
- [Ansible: ansible.builtin.default `result_format` Options](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/default_callback.html#parameter-result_format)

You can list all of the built-in (or available) callbacks with `ansible-doc -t callback -l`, then print similar examples to what's available on Anisble's online documentation with something like `ansible-doc -t callback ansible.builtin.default`.

Not all of these callbacks are specifically for affecting stderr and stdout. You'll want to review callbacks that seem interesting and check for options or environment variables that can be applied.

!!! tip "ansible.cfg Search Order Priority"

	[ansible.cfg file search order priority](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/config.html):

	- `ANSIBLE_CONFIG` (environment variable if set)
	- `ansible.cfg` (in the current directory)
	- `~/.ansible.cfg` (in the home directory)
	- `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`

	You can set just one option in your environment, and Ansible will [still use the defaults or whatever is in your `ansible.cfg` file, for everything else](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/general_precedence.html#general-precedence-rules).

To simply have more human-readable CLI output, use the YAML `result_format`:

```bash
export ANSIBLE_CALLBACK_RESULT_FORMAT='yaml'
# Now execute a playbook in the same shell environment
```


## Quick Start: Testing Plays

[Creating a playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/getting_started/get_started_playbook.html)

Use this yaml block as a copy-and-paste starting point when developing and testing plays on a single machine "locally" with ansible installed.

This is useful to run only certain parts of a playbook or isolate certain tasks to debug them.

```yaml
# Write as: playbook.yml
# Run with: ansible-playbook ./playbook.yml
# https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/getting_started/get_started_playbook.html
# https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/connection_details.html#running-against-localhost
# https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/debug_module.html
- name: Debug Playbook
  hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  vars:
    user_defined_var: True
  tasks:
    - name: Prints message only if user_defined_var variable is set to True
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "User defined variable set to: {{ user_defined_var }}"
      when: user_defined_var == True
    - name: Ping localhost
      ansible.builtin.ping:
```

## How Ansible Works

It's important to remember, for example, the `ansible.builtin.copy` module copies files *from* **the control node** *to* **managed nodes**, unless [`remote_src: yes`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/copy_module.html#parameter-remote_src) is set.

If `remote_src: yes` is set, `ansible.builtin.copy` will only use source paths on the remote host and not the control node.

Basically, *all tasks are typically executed on remote targets*. This means using `ansible.builtin.find` + registering a variable + `ansible.builtin.copy`, to copy arbitrary files *from* the control node won't work.

In that case, `ansible.builtin.find` will execute on the remote host, and not find the files. `ansible.builtin.copy` will attempt to use source paths on the remote host that don't exist instead of paths on the control node, causing this operation to fail.


## Variables and Inventories

*Currently, most roles in this repo have variables defined in `vars/main.yml`. This file takes precedence in most cases. Using `defaults/main.yml` for variables instead allows you to define the default there, and override those defaults in your inventory file(s) on a per-host or per-group level. This note will be removed and changed when all current roles are revised to reflect this.*

Example default value for a variable in `defaults/main.yml`:

```yml
some_var: "false"
```

Ansible has modular ways of approaching and maintaining both, variables and an inventory at the same time.

- [Assign variables per-machine](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_inventory.html#assigning-a-variable-to-one-machine-host-variables)
- [Assign variables to machine groups](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_inventory.html#assigning-a-variable-to-many-machines-group-variables)

Change `some_var` to `"true"` for just one host in your inventory:

```ini
10.0.0.40:22 ansible_user=user some_var="true"
```

Change `some_var` to `"true"` for all hosts in a specific inventory group:

```ini
[remotegroup]
10.0.0.41:22 ansible_user=user
10.0.0.42:22 ansible_user=user
10.0.0.43:22 ansible_user=user

[remotegroup:vars]
some_var="true"
```

Finally, be sure your `playbook.yml` file allows for either `all` groups, or the groups defined in your inventory file(s). If using `all`, you must ensure each inventory file has unique definitions to avoid collisions.

```yml
- name: "Default Playbook"
  hosts:
    # List groups from your inventory here
    # You could also use the built in "all" or "ungrouped"
    # "all" is necessary when Vagrant is auto-generating the inventory
    all
    #localgroup
    #remotegroup
    #tester_nodes
    #target_nodes
  roles:
  <SNIP>
```

See the following reference:

- [Playbook Variables: Tips on where to set variables](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_variables.html#tips-on-where-to-set-variables)


## Windows Provisioning

You effectively have two options for opening Windows endpoints to Ansible provisioning:

- WinRM (Domain-Joined, ideally with Kerberos auth, [otherwise there's a less secure work around](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-documentation/blob/devel/examples/scripts/ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1))
- [SSH (Best for non-domain-joined endpoints)](https://github.com/straysheep-dev/windows-configs/blob/main/Manage-OpenSSHServer.ps1)

*[There's also PSRemoting over SSH, available to Windows, Linux, and macOS. The PowerShell version installed must be 7.X or later](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/security/remoting/ssh-remoting-in-powershell?view=powershell-7.4).*

Update your `inventory.ini` file by appending the following options to your Windows endpoints:

- `cmd` is the default shell for SSH on Windows
- Change this to `powershell` if you've defined PowerShell as the default SSH login shell
- `ansible_become_user` is better to be specified per host in the inventory file
- `ansible_become_password` may be necessary (with LAPS), use an ansible-vault to store these values
- `ansible_become_method: runas` can be specified per task just like `sudo`

```ini
[remotehosts]
# "Minimum" possible settings, if tasks specify `become_method: runas`
10.55.55.30:22 ansible_user=User ansible_become_user=User ansible_connection=ssh ansible_shell_type=cmd

# Additional settings for password, and become_method
10.55.55.31:22 ansible_user=User ansible_become_user=User ansible_become_password='{{ User_runas_pass }}' ansible_connection=ssh ansible_shell_type=cmd ansible_become_method=runas
```

Your tasks will have to reflect these kinds of settings as well, using `runas` instead of `sudo` when Windows is detected.

See the following references:

- [Ansible Privilege Escalation: `become` Connection Variables](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_privilege_escalation.html#become-connection-variables)
- [Ansible Playbook Fails on Windows](https://devops.stackexchange.com/questions/16532/ansible-playbook-fails-on-windows-server)
- [Ansible Playbook Become Error](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66671945/ansible-playbook-error-the-powershell-shell-family-is-incompatible-with-the-sud)

Execute with:

```bash
~/.local/bin/ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini -v ./playbook.yml
```


## Ansible-Vault

- [ansible-vault](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/cli/ansible-vault.html)
- [become-connection-variables](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_privilege_escalation.html#become-connection-variables)
- [playbooks-vault](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/vault_guide/vault_using_encrypted_content.html#playbooks-vault)

This utility is included with `ansible`, and allows you to create encyrpted ansible `.yml` files. It's primarily used for encrypting secrets used for plays, but can even be used to encrypt an entire role.

Create an encrypted file (called a vault):
```bash
ansible-vault create vault.yml
# Enter a password, then edit / write the file in the default text editor (vim)
```


### Vault Password File + Environment Variables

In cases where you're running multiple playbooks, it can be tedious to repeatedly enter the vault password. Ansible has a `--vault-pass-file` option that can read the password from a file. *Unfortunately, Ansible doesn't have a built in environment variable you can pass to it for this purpose.* Writing this secret in a plaintext file isn't the best idea, and interestingly enough **you can specify commands or scripts as the vault-pass-file**. This means you can use a similar trick to [configuring terraform environment variables](https://github.com/straysheep-dev/terraform-configs#quick-start-environment-variables) and read the vault password from an environment variable.

See these references for a full breakdown, they're summarized below:

- [Enter Vault Password Once for Multiple Playbooks](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77622261/how-to-pass-a-password-to-the-vault-id-in-a-bash-script)
- [How to Pass an Ansible Vault a Password](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62690097/how-to-pass-ansible-vault-password-as-an-extra-var/76236662)
- [Get Password from the Environment with `curl`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33794842/forcing-curl-to-get-a-password-from-the-environment/33818945#33818945)
- [Get Password from Shell Script without Echoing](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3980668/how-to-get-a-password-from-a-shell-script-without-echoing#3980904)

First, enter the vault password with `read`:

```bash
echo "Enter Vault Password"; read -r -s vault_pass; export ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD=$vault_pass
```

- `-s` hides the text as you type
- `-r` interprets any backslashes correctly, see [SC2162](https://www.shellcheck.net/wiki/SC2162)
- The environment variable only appears in the `env` of that shell session
- It does not appear in the history of that shell
- Another shell running under the same user context cannot see that environment variable without a process dump

Execute with:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i <inventory> -e "@~/secrets/auth.yml" --vault-pass-file <(cat <<<$ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD) -v ./playbook.yml
```

- Uses `<(cat <<<$VARIABLE)` process substitution and creates a here-string
- The raw value will not appear in your process list
- Using [pspy](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy) you can verify this
- Be sure `kernel.yama.ptrace_scope` is set to `1` or higher, as `0` will allow process dumping without root


### Use Case: Manage Remote Hosts with Unique Sudo Passwords

This covers the following scenario:

- You have two or more remote hosts with a normal user using `sudo` instead of root
- You need to update all of them weekly
- You do not want plain text passwords in yaml files
- Each remote host's `sudo` user has your ssh public key, and only accepts public key authentication

A clear way to manage this and illustrate how this works is by creating a new vault file (we'll call it `auth.yml`) containing all of the remote user passwords.

```bash
ansible-vault create auth.yml
# Specify a vault password, generate and save this to a password manager
```

The content of auth.yml could look like this:

```conf
admin_sudo_pass: 53Zbr3DPpfzGKSbWxNgWareBgNptKt5s
sql_admin_sudo_pass: 3KYRoAndmF53XDu33No7jfsNv2jrrpLi
```

Then the contents of `inventory/inventory.ini` could look like this:

```ini
10.20.30.40:2222 ansible_user=admin ansible_become_password='{{ admin_sudo_pass }}'
10.20.30.41:2222 ansible_user=sql_admin ansible_become_password='{{ sql_admin_sudo_pass }}'
```

To execute the playbook, specifying the `auth.yml` file with `-e "@auth.yml"`, and instead of `--ask-become-pass`, use `--ask-vault-pass`. Ansible will check the vaulted `auth.yml` file for the sudo passwords now instead of expecting them to be passed right after executing this command where typically it will only accept one input string for `become_pass`, which is the problem this solves.

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory/inventory.ini --ask-vault-pass --extra-vars "@auth.yml" -v playbook.yml
```

This can be taken further by also encrypting the usernames as variables in `auth.yml`.


## Ansible-Lint

For guidance on writing Ansible code, reference the [Ansible Lint Documentation](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/lint/).

`ansible-lint` can be used on your playbooks, roles, or collections to check for common mistakes when writing ansible code.

- [Installing `ansible-lint`](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/lint/installing/#installing-the-latest-version)
- [GitHub Action: run-ansible-lint](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-ansible-lint)
- [GitHub Action: ansible-lint.yml Example](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lint?tab=readme-ov-file#using-ansible-lint-as-a-github-action)

There are a number of ways to do this, but you can install `ansible-lint` just like `ansible`.

With `pipx`:

```bash
pipx install ansible-lint
```

With `pipx`, using a specific version:

```bash
version_number="1.2.3"
package_name='ansible-lint'
pipx install --suffix=_"$version_number" "$package_name"=="$version_number"
```

With `pip`:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user ansible-lint
```

- [Configuring ansible-lint](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/lint/configuring/)

The "new" way to do this, if you also intend to leverage the [latest GitHub action](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lint) in your CI/CD pipeline, is to use a configuration file to specify what `ansible-lint` should be checking. `ansible-lint` will look in the current directory, and then ascend directories, until getting to the git project root, [looking for one of the following filenames](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/lint/configuring/#using-local-configuration-files):

- `.ansible-lint`, this file lives in the project root
- `.config/ansible-lint.yml`, this file exists within a `.config` folder
- `.config/ansible-lint.yaml`, same as the previous file

!!! note ""

	*When using the `.config/` path, any paths specified in the `ansible-lint.yml` config file must have `../` prepended so ansible-lint can find them correctly.*

The easiest way to start, is with a [profile](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/lint/profiles/), and excluding the `meta/` and `tests/` paths in roles. This is a less verbose version of the `.ansible-lint` file used in this repo.

```yml
# .ansible-lint

# Full list of configuration options:
# https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/lint/configuring/

# Profiles: null, min, basic, moderate, safety, shared, production
# From left to right, the requirements to pass the profile checks become more strict.
# Safety is a good starting point.
profile: safety

# Shell globs are supported for exclude_paths:
# - https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lint/pull/1425
# - https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lint/discussions/1424
exclude_paths:
  - .cache/      # implicit unless exclude_paths is defined in config
  - .git/        # always ignore
  - .github/     # always ignore
  - "*/tests/"   # ignore tests/ folder for all roles
  - "*/meta/"    # ignore meta/ folder for all roles

# These are checks that may often cause errors / failures.
# If you need to make exceptions for any check, add it here.
warn_list:
  - yaml[line-length]

# Offline mode disables installation of requirements.yml and schema refreshing
offline: true

```

Over time you may want to shift the profile to `shared` or `production`, and also tell `ansible-lint` to check the `tests/` and `meta/` paths for each role if you intend to publish them to ansible-galaxy.

**Errors**

Older versions of ansible-lint may produces errors that are difficult to diagnose. When this happens, use a very simple main.yml file, and start slowly adding tasks or vars to this file. Once you identify a task that creates an error, you can begin narrowing down which line(s) in the task or vars are producing the error.

One example of this is new versions of ansible lint will want you to use `become_method: ansible.builtin.sudo`, while older versions require `become_method: sudo` and will generate a `schema[tasks]` error in this case.


## Ansible-Galaxy

This is the suggested way to share and run roles or collections. Though you ***can*** run them using local paths, you're meant to reference them using a fully-qualified-name (FQN in Ansible terms).

- [Ansible-Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/)
- [Ansible-Galaxy User Guide (`ansible-galaxy`)](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/galaxy/user_guide.html)
- [Ansible-Galaxy User Guide (Platform and API)](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/galaxy-ng/en/latest/community/userguide.html#servers)
- [Create Ansible Roles or Collections](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/cli/ansible-galaxy.html#role-init)
- [Role Naming Conventions](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/developing_collections_structure.html#roles-directory)

When creating roles that will be published, you'll need to fill out the `meta.yml` details:

- [Role Meta: Supported Platforms (GH Issue: 52)](https://github.com/ansible/galaxy/issues/52)
- [Role Meta: Supported Platforms (`ansible-lint` schema)](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lint/blob/main/src/ansiblelint/schemas/meta.json)

The documentation (at the time of writing) suggested making an `~/.ansible.cfg` to target the beta galaxy_ng server, however this is no longer working (in other words, the galaxy_ng server is no longer in beta and is now the default). It seems the best way to do this is by providing your API key on the command line, through an environment variable:

```bash
echo "Enter Galaxy API Token"; read -r -s ansible_galaxy_token; export ANSIBLE_GALAXY_TOKEN=$ansible_galaxy_token
# [type or paste your key, it won't echo or show up in your bash history]
ansible-galaxy role import -vvv --token $ANSIBLE_GALAXY_TOKEN <github-username> <ansible-role-my_repo>
```

The above command will add (import) a role from your GitHub, to your own Ansible-Galaxy namespace, so that others can download and install it directly from the `ansible-galaxy` command.
