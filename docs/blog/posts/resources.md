Information, compiled for easy reference.

!!! abstract "CI/CD Your Notes"

    This set of links and notes has been my longest running note file, originally started back in cherrytree before making its way to this page.

    The idea has been to create a searchable location pointing to each of these things, sorted by category, and with notes around them. This is currently a work in progess as entries need to be reformatted and updated as they move from my notes onto this page.

## Utilities

??? info "rustdesk"

	An open source, robust remote desktop alternative, has desktop and mobile clients and is designed for self-hosting.

	This was [covered by Network Chuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXL8mMUXs88) as an alternative to every other remote desktop option out there.

	- <https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk>


??? info "ghostty"

	Fast, feature rich, native terminal emulator.

	This tool was mentioned on Daniel Miessler's [UL NO. 463](https://newsletter.danielmiessler.com/p/ul-463).

??? question "unfurl"

	> Unfurl takes a URL and expands ("unfurls") it into a directed graph, extracting every bit of information from the URL and exposing the obscured. It does this by breaking up a URL into components, extracting as much information as it can from each piece, and presenting it all visually.

	Discovered in [this SANS diary](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Unfurl%20v2025.02%20released/31716/). This tool has both a local web interface and a command line option for viewing the data returned.

## Note Taking

The best advice I've heard about note taking is 1) it should work for you, and 2) it should export to a common format like Markdown so you can move to another notes platform easily. This can be multiple apps, or just one. It's whatever works best for you and the goals you have.

??? note "Standard-Notes"

	> Standard Notes is an end-to-end encrypted note-taking app for digitalists and professionals. Capture your notes, files, and life's work all in one secure place.

	It works across all major platforms, desktop and web, using end-to-end encrypted syncing through their servers to all of your devices. Robust markdown formatting, a secrets vault, and even limited spreadsheet capability for paid subscriptions. Standard Notes is one of the most security and privacy focused of the various note taking applications, making efforts to function similar to a password manager with how it handles memory and data on-device.

	You could also self-host the client and server components, using tailscale to safely access it from your endpoints.

??? note "Obsidian"

	Perhaps the most popular notes application for infosec professionals and developers (as of the time of writing this). Obsidian features robust note taking and visualization capabilities through linking notes and creating a graph of how they relate. It works using markdown files saved to your device. Paid plans include end-to-end encrypted note sync.

	- <https://obsidian.md/>
	- <https://github.com/obsidianmd>

??? note "Joplin"

	> Joplin is a free, open source note taking and to-do application, which can handle a large number of notes organised into notebooks. The notes are searchable, can be copied, tagged and modified either from the applications directly or from your own text editor. The notes are in Markdown format. The notes can be securely synchronised using end-to-end encryption with various cloud services including Nextcloud, Dropbox, OneDrive and Joplin Cloud.

	This application is often referenced in relation to note taking for pentesting courses and certifications. It's fairly easy to install and functions entirely offline by default.

	- License: AGPL-3.0-or-later

??? note "Notion"

	Notion is a note taking platform. Desktop apps are available but you can use it entirely through the web application. It is possibly the most feature-rich note taking platform available. If your subscription includes the AI component, it's practical and immediately usable out of the box.

	These notes are not end-to-end encrypted, and may not be the best option without an enterprise subscription if your notes include customer data.

	- <https://www.notion.com/>

??? note "Cherrytree"

	> A hierarchical note taking application, featuring rich text and syntax highlighting, storing data in either a single file (xml or sqlite) or multiple files and directories.

	This is often available by default in Kali Linux and frequently referenced in relation to note taking for pentesting courses and certifications.

	Primarily supports Windows and Linux (snap and flatpaks are available too).

## Hypervisors

??? example "Proxmox"

	Proxmox is a complete open-source platform for virtualization. Built on Debian, it uses a web frontend to manage VM's and containers. You can install and use GUI and headless VM's, as well as manage and work with the underlying OS from a shell. For example it's entirely possible to install an EDR agent onto Proxmox, since it's Debian under the hood.

	- <https://www.proxmox.com/en/>
	- <https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/>

	The ISO URL points to an /iso/ folder on the Proxmox webiste. Browsing this manually reveals the following files:

	<https://enterprise.proxmox.com/iso/SHA256SUMS.txt>
	<https://enterprise.proxmox.com/iso/SHA256SUMS.asc>

	You can use these along with the following public key to verify the ISO's integrity.

	```bash
	gpg --keyserver hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com:443 --recv-keys 'F4E136C67CDCE41AE6DE6FC81140AF8F639E0C39'

	uid                   [ unknown] Proxmox Bookworm Release Key <proxmox-release@proxmox.com>
	```

??? example "VMware"

	‚ö†Ô∏è TO DO ‚ö†Ô∏è

??? example "VirtualBox"

	VirtualBox is often available in the default Linux repositories, but the **latest supported and patched** version is available directly from VirtualBox's offical repo.

	> VirtualBox is a general-purpose full virtualization software for x86_64 hardware (with version 7.1 additionally for macOS/Arm), targeted at laptop, desktop, server and embedded use.

	It works on Windows, macOS, Linux, and more. You'll also want the VirtualBox Extension Pack if you require USB pass-through or any other advanced features. It's free for personal use and is under a separate license agreement.

	- <https://www.virtualbox.org/>
	- <https://www.virtualbox.org/download/oracle_vbox_2016.asc>

	Oracle Corporation (VirtualBox archive signing key) <info@virtualbox.org>
	```

??? example "QEMU"

	QEMU is available through your Linux distro's default package repos, and macOS's Homebrew / MacPorts. This is the recommended way to install it.

	QEMU could be thought of as the Hyper-V of Linux. It benefits from the KVM acceleration on Linux making the performance incredible, and in some sense is the most ubiquitously supported hypervisor across the distros, likely because of the KVM integration. You'll see this on Ubuntu where `apt` now checks to see if QEMU VM's are running.

	This is just my opinion and experience after moving to Hyper-V and QEMU from VMWare and VirtualBox. QEMU is also being used by Proxmox, which is another benefit to building and understanding QEMU images if you're using QEMU for desktop use cases and Proxmox as a virtualization server.

## Home Labs & Simulations

??? example "GOAD (Game of Active Directory)"

	> The purpose of this tool is to give pentesters a vulnerable Active directory environment ready to use to practice usual attack techniques. The idea behind this project is to give you an environment where you can try and train your pentest skills without having the pain to build all by yourself. This repository was build for pentest practice.

	Effectively, this can spin up really fast (as quick as a couple hours) on a Kali Linux host running VirtualBox as the Hypervisor. There's also a Proxmox option, but for this you may want to look at Ludus below.

	It goes without saying you need a fair amount of resources to run this, and it will be extremely expensive in the cloud.

	- <https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/GOAD>
	- <https://orange-cyberdefense.github.io/GOAD/>

??? example "Ludus"

	This was initially discovered on [Paul's Security Weekly #861](https://securityweekly.com/psw-861). It appears to be built on top of Proxmox *and* Game of AD, with a number of other options and features for a completely automated home lab experience.

	> Ludus is a system to build easy-to-use cyber environments, or "ranges" for testing and development.
	>
	> Built on Proxmox, Ludus enables advanced automation while still allowing easy manual modifications or setup of virtual machines and networks.

	- <https://gitlab.com/badsectorlabs/ludus>

??? example "SamuraiWTF (Web Training Framework)"

	This version of the project is expirimental only for now.

	- <https://github.com/secureideas/samuraiwtf>


??? example "VulnServer"

	An intentionally vulnerable listening process, meant to demonstrate buffer overflows.

	This project is referenced in many buffer overflow practice courses. The source code is short enough to read over in a few minutes and can be compiled fairly easily, meaning you can make changes and attempt to patch the code to remove the vulnerability too.

	- <https://github.com/stephenbradshaw/vulnserver>

??? example "OWASP Juice Shop"

	> OWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure web application! It can be used in security trainings, awareness demos, CTFs and as a guinea pig for security tools! Juice Shop encompasses vulnerabilities from the entire OWASP Top Ten along with many other security flaws found in real-world applications!

## Pentesting

??? abstract "PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard)"

	The PTES is a standard first drafted in 2009. It's designed to provide both businesses and security service providers with a common language and scope for performing penetration testing. It's been referenced in a number of training courses and by those who helped create it over the years. [The FAQ provides additonal overview](https://github.com/OpenSBK/ptes/blob/main/faq.md).

	Kevin Johnson (SecureIdeas, OpenSBK) was on [Paul's Security Weekly #785](https://securityweekly.com/psw-785) to talk about this updated version of the PTES, now on GitHub for others to contribute to. It was mentioned again in [SWN-453](https://securityweekly.com/swn-453), where one of OpenSBK's goals in addition to updating the PTES will be defining the language used in InfoSec.

??? question "nmap"

	Perhaps the most well known network scanner available.

	- <https://nmap.org/>

??? question "naabu"

	> A fast port scanner written in go with a focus on reliability and simplicity. Designed to be used in combination with other tools for attack surface discovery in bug bounties and pentests

	naabu's release binaries are statically compiled. This is incredibly useful if you're struggling to get a statically compiled `nmap` to run on a machine.

	- <https://github.com/projectdiscovery/naabu>

??? question "masscan"

	> TCP port scanner, spews SYN packets asynchronously, scanning entire Internet in under 5 minutes.

### Wireless

??? example "WiFiChallengeLab-docker"

	This is one of the most useful resources to learning nearly all wireless recon and attack paths in a safe and isolated environment. Deployment options include:

	- Pull the VM from Vagrant or GitHub releases
	- Alternatively install and run the entire lab through docker on a VM or host you have

	My preference is to configure a Kali Linux VM as I would to prepare it for wireless testing, and run the lab via docker on top of it. Your VM will have virtual wireless cards added through the 80211_hwsim kernel module. You can use these to interact with the containerized AP's as if they were "real".

	> Docker version of WiFiChallenge Lab with modifications in the challenges and improved stability. Ubuntu virtual machine with virtualized networks and clients to perform WiFi attacks on OPN, WPA2, WPA3 and Enterprise networks.

	- <https://github.com/r4ulcl/WiFiChallengeLab-docker>

??? abstract "Microsoft Baselines"

	The download center link has all of the baselining tools available, including LGPO.exe and the PolicyAnalyzer.

	The idea with the .PolicyRules files is they are configurations that are pre-made by Microsoft and ready to be installed using LGPO.exe

	You can do all of this manually with PowerShell, and you will ultimately want to familiarize yourself with the descriptions of each setting should you run into any issues, but this will save a ton of time in getting things up and running.

	Use PolicyAnalyzer.exe to view the `*.PolicyRules` files, compare them to other `*.PolicyRules` files, or even your current system settings.

	The remaining files are the raw policies for each "thing", including Windows 10 and 11 endpoints, Windows Server, Microsoft Edge, and M365 apps. When applied they create a hardened environment from a security perspective while maintaining functionality.

??? bug "EMBA"

	EMBA was discovered through Paul's Security Weekly. It's been covered in too many episodes to pinpoint which one *I* initially heard it from.

	> EMBA is designed as the central firmware analysis and SBOM tool for penetration testers, product security teams, developers and responsible product managers. It supports the complete security analysis process starting with firmware extraction, doing static analysis and dynamic analysis via emulation, building the SBOM and finally generating a web based vulnerability report. EMBA automatically discovers possible weak spots and vulnerabilities in firmware. Examples are insecure binaries, old and outdated software components, potentially vulnerable scripts, or hard-coded passwords. EMBA is a command line tool with the possibility to generate an easy-to-use web report for further analysis.

	EMBA requires *a lot* of compute resources. See the [prerequisites](https://github.com/e-m-b-a/emba/wiki/Installation#prerequisites) for details. For reference, your EMBA VM should have 8vCPU's and 16GB RAM as the *minimum*.
