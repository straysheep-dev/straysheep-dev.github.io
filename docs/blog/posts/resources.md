!!! abstract "CI/CD Your Notes"

    This set of links and notes has been my longest running note file, originally started back in cherrytree before making its way to this page.

    The idea has been to create a searchable location pointing to each of these things, sorted by category, and with notes around them. This is currently a work in progess as entries need to be reformatted and updated as they move from my notes onto this page.

## Utilities

??? info "rustdesk"

	An open source, robust remote desktop alternative, has desktop and mobile clients and is designed for self-hosting.

	This was [covered by Network Chuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXL8mMUXs88) as an alternative to every other remote desktop option out there.

	- <https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk>


??? info "ghostty"

	Fast, feature rich, native terminal emulator.

	This tool was mentioned on Daniel Miessler's [UL NO. 463](https://newsletter.danielmiessler.com/p/ul-463).

	- <https://ghostty.org/>
	- <https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty>

??? question "unfurl"

	> Unfurl takes a URL and expands ("unfurls") it into a directed graph, extracting every bit of information from the URL and exposing the obscured. It does this by breaking up a URL into components, extracting as much information as it can from each piece, and presenting it all visually.

	Discovered in [this SANS diary](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Unfurl%20v2025.02%20released/31716/). This tool has both a local web interface and a command line option for viewing the data returned.

	- <https://github.com/obsidianforensics/unfurl>

??? example "bubbletea"

	> The fun, functional and stateful way to build terminal apps. A Go framework based on The Elm Architecture. Bubble Tea is well-suited for simple and complex terminal applications, either inline, full-window, or a mix of both.

	- <https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea>

??? bug "Dangerzone"

	> Take potentially dangerous PDFs, office documents, or images and convert them to a safe PDF.
	>
	> Dangerzone works like this: You give it a document that you don't know if you can trust (for example, an email attachment). Inside of a sandbox, Dangerzone converts the document to a PDF (if it isn't already one), and then converts the PDF into raw pixel data: a huge list of RGB color values for each page. Then, outside of the sandbox, Dangerzone takes this pixel data and converts it back into a PDF.

	- <https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone>

	List of features (from the README):

	- Sandboxes don't have network access, so if a malicious document can compromise one, it can't phone home
	- Sandboxes use gVisor, an application kernel written in Go, that implements a substantial portion of the Linux system call interface.
	- Dangerzone can optionally OCR the safe PDFs it creates, so it will have a text layer again
	- Dangerzone compresses the safe PDF to reduce file size
	- After converting, Dangerzone lets you open the safe PDF in the PDF viewer of your choice, which allows you to open PDFs and office docs in Dangerzone by default so you never accidentally open a dangerous document

??? question "magika"

	> Magika is a novel AI powered file type detection tool that relies on the recent advance of deep learning to provide accurate detection. Under the hood, Magika employs a custom, highly optimized Keras model that only weighs about a few MBs, and enables precise file identification within milliseconds, even when running on a single CPU.

	- <https://github.com/google/magika>

??? info "Ladybird"

	> Ladybird is a truly independent web browser, using a novel engine based on web standards.

	Discovered by following [p0dalirius](https://github.com/p0dalirius?tab=stars), this appears to be focused on *nix and macOS desktop environments for it's first release in 2026 / 2027.

	- <https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird>

??? info "topgrade"

	Discovered on [Paul's Security Weekly #864](https://securityweekly.com/psw-864). topgrade is a way to "upgrade all the things" on a Linux system. This includes apt/dnf, snap, flatpak, LVFS / firmware, and so on.

## Note Taking

The best advice I've heard about note taking is 1) it should work for you, and 2) it should export to a common format like Markdown so you can move to another notes platform easily. This can be multiple apps, or just one. It's whatever works best for you and the goals you have.

??? note "Standard-Notes"

	> Standard Notes is an end-to-end encrypted note-taking app for digitalists and professionals. Capture your notes, files, and life's work all in one secure place.

	It works across all major platforms, desktop and web, using end-to-end encrypted syncing through their servers to all of your devices. Robust markdown formatting, a secrets vault, and even limited spreadsheet capability for paid subscriptions. Standard Notes is one of the most security and privacy focused of the various note taking applications, making efforts to function similar to a password manager with how it handles memory and data on-device.

	You could also self-host the client and server components, using tailscale to safely access it from your endpoints.

??? note "Obsidian"

	Perhaps the most popular notes application for infosec professionals and developers (as of the time of writing this). Obsidian features robust note taking and visualization capabilities through linking notes and creating a graph of how they relate. It works using markdown files saved to your device. Paid plans include end-to-end encrypted note sync.

	- <https://obsidian.md/>
	- <https://github.com/obsidianmd>

??? note "Joplin"

	> Joplin is a free, open source note taking and to-do application, which can handle a large number of notes organised into notebooks. The notes are searchable, can be copied, tagged and modified either from the applications directly or from your own text editor. The notes are in Markdown format. The notes can be securely synchronised using end-to-end encryption with various cloud services including Nextcloud, Dropbox, OneDrive and Joplin Cloud.

	This application is often referenced in relation to note taking for pentesting courses and certifications. It's fairly easy to install and functions entirely offline by default.

	- <https://github.com/laurent22/joplin>
	- License: AGPL-3.0-or-later

??? note "Notion"

	Notion is a note taking platform. Desktop apps are available but you can use it entirely through the web application. It is possibly the most feature-rich note taking platform available. If your subscription includes the AI component, it's practical and immediately usable out of the box.

	These notes are not end-to-end encrypted, and may not be the best option without an enterprise subscription if your notes include customer data.

	- <https://www.notion.com/>

??? note "Cherrytree"

	> A hierarchical note taking application, featuring rich text and syntax highlighting, storing data in either a single file (xml or sqlite) or multiple files and directories.

	This is often available by default in Kali Linux and frequently referenced in relation to note taking for pentesting courses and certifications.

	Primarily supports Windows and Linux (snap and flatpaks are available too).

	- <https://docs.openmediavault.org/en/stable/installation/index.html>


## Hypervisors

??? example "Proxmox"

	Proxmox is a complete open-source platform for virtualization. Built on Debian, it uses a web frontend to manage VM's and containers. You can install and use GUI and headless VM's, as well as manage and work with the underlying OS from a shell. For example it's entirely possible to install an EDR agent onto Proxmox, since it's Debian under the hood.

	- <https://www.proxmox.com/en/>
	- <https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/>

	The ISO URL points to an /iso/ folder on the Proxmox webiste. Browsing this manually reveals the following files:

	<https://enterprise.proxmox.com/iso/SHA256SUMS.txt>
	<https://enterprise.proxmox.com/iso/SHA256SUMS.asc>

	You can use these along with the following public key to verify the ISO's integrity.

	```bash
	gpg --keyserver hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com:443 --recv-keys 'F4E136C67CDCE41AE6DE6FC81140AF8F639E0C39'

??? example "VMware"

	‚ö†Ô∏è TO DO ‚ö†Ô∏è

??? example "VirtualBox"

	VirtualBox is often available in the default Linux repositories, but the **latest supported and patched** version is available directly from VirtualBox's offical repo.

	> VirtualBox is a general-purpose full virtualization software for x86_64 hardware (with version 7.1 additionally for macOS/Arm), targeted at laptop, desktop, server and embedded use.

	It works on Windows, macOS, Linux, and more. You'll also want the VirtualBox Extension Pack if you require USB pass-through or any other advanced features. It's free for personal use and is under a separate license agreement.

	Oracle Corporation (VirtualBox archive signing key) <info@virtualbox.org>
	```

??? example "QEMU"

	QEMU is available through your Linux distro's default package repos, and macOS's Homebrew / MacPorts. This is the recommended way to install it.

	QEMU could be thought of as the Hyper-V of Linux. It benefits from the KVM acceleration on Linux making the performance incredible, and in some sense is the most ubiquitously supported hypervisor across the distros, likely because of the KVM integration. You'll see this on Ubuntu where `apt` now checks to see if QEMU VM's are running.

	This is just my opinion and experience after moving to Hyper-V and QEMU from VMWare and VirtualBox. QEMU is also being used by Proxmox, which is another benefit to building and understanding QEMU images if you're using QEMU for desktop use cases and Proxmox as a virtualization server.

??? example "GOAD (Game of Active Directory)"

	> The purpose of this tool is to give pentesters a vulnerable Active directory environment ready to use to practice usual attack techniques. The idea behind this project is to give you an environment where you can try and train your pentest skills without having the pain to build all by yourself. This repository was build for pentest practice.

	Effectively, this can spin up really fast (as quick as a couple hours) on a Kali Linux host running VirtualBox as the Hypervisor. There's also a Proxmox option, but for this you may want to look at Ludus below.

	It goes without saying you need a fair amount of resources to run this, and it will be extremely expensive in the cloud.

??? example "Ludus"

	This was initially discovered on [Paul's Security Weekly #861](https://securityweekly.com/psw-861). It appears to be built on top of Proxmox *and* Game of AD, with a number of other options and features for a completely automated home lab experience.

	> Ludus is a system to build easy-to-use cyber environments, or "ranges" for testing and development.
	>
	> Built on Proxmox, Ludus enables advanced automation while still allowing easy manual modifications or setup of virtual machines and networks.

??? example "VulnServer"

	An intentionally vulnerable listening process, meant to demonstrate buffer overflows.

	This project is referenced in many buffer overflow practice courses. The source code is short enough to read over in a few minutes and can be compiled fairly easily, meaning you can make changes and attempt to patch the code to remove the vulnerability too.

??? example "Packer"

	> Packer is a tool that lets you create identical machine images for multiple platforms from a single source template. Packer can create golden images to use in image pipelines.

	- <https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer>

	Packer literally builds virtual machines images. Think of installing Kali or Windows from the ISO manually in VMware, Hyper-V, VirtualBox, QEMU, or anywhere else (supported by packer). Packer actually automates those steps, even down to the boot key presses so you can build and configure a VM with zero interaction. You can see this happen in real time if you aren't running packer in headless mode. The VM GUI window will open as if you were doing the install yourself, and you can watch it run.

	To really utilize packer, you'll need to learn and implemenet (depending on the OS and technology available) cloud-init, autoinstall, preseed, or similar auto-provisioning mechanisms so you don't have to manually intervene.

	You can also post-process the install with additional shell commands, scripts, Ansible playbooks, and more.

	The resulting images can be imported into a hypervisor, sent to a cloud provider as the disk image for a cloud VM, or converted into a Vagrant box image.

??? example "Vagrant"

	> Vagrant is the command line utility for managing the lifecycle of virtual machines. Isolate dependencies and their configuration within a single disposable and consistent environment.

	My preference is to configure a Kali Linux VM as I would to prepare it for wireless testing, and run the lab via docker on top of it. Your VM will have virtual wireless cards added through the 80211_hwsim kernel module. You can use these to interact with the containerized AP's as if they were "real".

### Known Samples

??? bug "xz-utils Backdoor"

	> Malicious code was discovered in the upstream tarballs of xz, starting with version 5.6.0. Through a series of complex obfuscations, the liblzma build process extracts a prebuilt object file from a disguised test file existing in the source code, which is then used to modify specific functions in the liblzma code. This results in a modified liblzma library that can be used by any software linked against this library, intercepting and modifying the data interaction with this library.

??? bug "EMBA"

	EMBA was discovered through Paul's Security Weekly. It's been covered in too many episodes to pinpoint which one *I* initially heard it from.

	> EMBA is designed as the central firmware analysis and SBOM tool for penetration testers, product security teams, developers and responsible product managers. It supports the complete security analysis process starting with firmware extraction, doing static analysis and dynamic analysis via emulation, building the SBOM and finally generating a web based vulnerability report. EMBA automatically discovers possible weak spots and vulnerabilities in firmware. Examples are insecure binaries, old and outdated software components, potentially vulnerable scripts, or hard-coded passwords. EMBA is a command line tool with the possibility to generate an easy-to-use web report for further analysis.

	EMBA requires *a lot* of compute resources. See the [prerequisites](https://github.com/e-m-b-a/emba/wiki/Installation#prerequisites) for details. For reference, your EMBA VM should have 8vCPU's and 16GB RAM as the *minimum*.

??? danger "baton drop (CVE-2022-21894)"

	> Windows Boot Applications allow the truncatememory setting to remove blocks of memory containing "persistent" ranges of serialised data from the memory map, leading to Secure Boot bypass.

	- <https://github.com/Wack0/CVE-2022-21894>


## Forensics

??? question "uac (Unix-like Artifacts Collector)"

	> UAC is a Live Response collection script for Incident Response that makes use of native binaries and tools to automate the collection of AIX, ESXi, FreeBSD, Linux, macOS, NetBSD, NetScaler, OpenBSD and Solaris systems artifacts. It was created to facilitate and speed up data collection, and depend less on remote support during incident response engagements.

	- <https://github.com/tclahr/uac>

	UAC is primarily an **evidence collection tool**. This isn't something like [linpeas](https://github.com/peass-ng/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS) that will alert you to possible leads as it's gathering evidence. It's a ton of output, and is a haystack in which you'd be trying to find a very small needle if you didn't already have an idea of what you're looking for. With this in mind, there are a few effective ideas on how to leverage this tool:

	- Assume you're compromised, hit each endpoint with UAC and pull the resulting evidence back to your IR machine
	- Investigate supsicious activity with system internals, using what you know while UAC runs
	- Use [linpeas](https://github.com/peass-ng/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS) to assess endpoints, it's not just a hacking tool, it will find IOC's

	If you have a possible lead or IOC, then your UAC evidence becomes invaluable. With the evidence back on your IR machine:

	- You can of course dig into specific evidence based on your potential IOC's
	- You could also use **[YARA](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara)** to hit the entire UAC evidence folder for IOC's, which is incredibly fast
