!!! abstract "CI/CD Your Notes"

    This set of links and notes has been my longest running note file, originally started back in cherrytree before making its way to this page.

    The idea has been to create a searchable location pointing to each of these things, sorted by category, and with notes around them. This is currently a work in progess as entries need to be reformatted and updated as they move from my notes onto this page.

## :material-toolbox: Utilities

??? info "rustdesk"

	An open source, robust remote desktop alternative, has desktop and mobile clients and is designed for self-hosting.

	This was [covered by Network Chuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXL8mMUXs88) as an alternative to every other remote desktop option out there.

	- <https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk>


??? info "ghostty"

	Fast, feature rich, native terminal emulator.

	This tool was mentioned on Daniel Miessler's [UL NO. 463](https://newsletter.danielmiessler.com/p/ul-463).

	- <https://ghostty.org/>
	- <https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty>

??? question "unfurl"

	> Unfurl takes a URL and expands ("unfurls") it into a directed graph, extracting every bit of information from the URL and exposing the obscured. It does this by breaking up a URL into components, extracting as much information as it can from each piece, and presenting it all visually.

	Discovered in [this SANS diary](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Unfurl%20v2025.02%20released/31716/). This tool has both a local web interface and a command line option for viewing the data returned.

	- <https://github.com/obsidianforensics/unfurl>

??? example "bubbletea"

	> The fun, functional and stateful way to build terminal apps. A Go framework based on The Elm Architecture. Bubble Tea is well-suited for simple and complex terminal applications, either inline, full-window, or a mix of both.

	- <https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea>

??? bug "Dangerzone"

	> Take potentially dangerous PDFs, office documents, or images and convert them to a safe PDF.
	>
	> Dangerzone works like this: You give it a document that you don't know if you can trust (for example, an email attachment). Inside of a sandbox, Dangerzone converts the document to a PDF (if it isn't already one), and then converts the PDF into raw pixel data: a huge list of RGB color values for each page. Then, outside of the sandbox, Dangerzone takes this pixel data and converts it back into a PDF.

	- <https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone>

	List of features (from the README):

	- Sandboxes don't have network access, so if a malicious document can compromise one, it can't phone home
	- Sandboxes use gVisor, an application kernel written in Go, that implements a substantial portion of the Linux system call interface.
	- Dangerzone can optionally OCR the safe PDFs it creates, so it will have a text layer again
	- Dangerzone compresses the safe PDF to reduce file size
	- After converting, Dangerzone lets you open the safe PDF in the PDF viewer of your choice, which allows you to open PDFs and office docs in Dangerzone by default so you never accidentally open a dangerous document

??? question "magika"

	> Magika is a novel AI powered file type detection tool that relies on the recent advance of deep learning to provide accurate detection. Under the hood, Magika employs a custom, highly optimized Keras model that only weighs about a few MBs, and enables precise file identification within milliseconds, even when running on a single CPU.

	- <https://github.com/google/magika>

??? info "Ladybird"

	> Ladybird is a truly independent web browser, using a novel engine based on web standards.

	Discovered by following [p0dalirius](https://github.com/p0dalirius?tab=stars), this appears to be focused on *nix and macOS desktop environments for it's first release in 2026 / 2027.

	- <https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird>

??? info "topgrade"

	Discovered on [Paul's Security Weekly #864](https://securityweekly.com/psw-864). topgrade is a way to "upgrade all the things" on a Linux system. This includes apt/dnf, snap, flatpak, LVFS / firmware, and so on.

	- <https://github.com/topgrade-rs/topgrade>

??? info "Terramaid"

	> A utility for generating Mermaid diagrams from Terraform configurations.

	- <https://github.com/RoseSecurity/Terramaid>


??? abstract "FileCloud Community Edition"

	The Community Edition is the free tier of the enterprise version, without certain enterprise features. It's geared towards home labs and personal use, while giving you expierence with the FileCloud platform.

	Uniquely, FileCloud has an MSI installer for deployment on Windows servers / desktops, and allows you to mount folders as network drives.

	Discovered on [NetworkChuck's video on Building your Own Cloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBIowQ0WaR8).

	- <https://ce.filecloud.com/>

??? abstract "NextCloud"

	A community driven, free and open source, self-hosted cloud solution.

	Discovered on [Network Chuck's video on Building your Own Cloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBIowQ0WaR8). The steps demonstrated for the docker install seem to be the easiest way to get setup in a lab environment that can move to "production" use for a home user.

	- <https://github.com/nextcloud>

??? info "opkssh"

	Discovered on the [SANS ISC Daily Stormcast, Monday March 31st episode in 2025](https://isc.sans.edu/podcastdetail/9386).

	> opkssh is a tool which enables ssh to be used with OpenID Connect allowing SSH access management via identities like alice@example.com instead of long-lived SSH keys. It does not replace ssh, but rather generates ssh public keys that contain PK Tokens and configures sshd to verify the PK Token in the ssh public key. These PK Tokens contain standard OpenID Connect ID Tokens. This protocol builds on the OpenPubkey which adds user public keys to OpenID Connect without breaking compatibility with existing OpenID Provider.
	>
	> Currently opkssh is compatible with Google, Microsoft/Azure and Gitlab OpenID Providers (OP). If you have a gmail, microsoft or a gitlab account you can ssh with that account.

	- <https://github.com/openpubkey/opkssh>

??? info "Etcher"

	> Etcher is a powerful OS image flasher built with web technologies to ensure flashing an SDCard or USB drive is a pleasant and safe experience. It protects you from accidentally writing to your hard-drives, ensures every byte of data was written correctly, and much more. It can also directly flash Raspberry Pi devices that support USB device boot mode.

	Etcher is one of the two go-to GUI-based imaging utilities for creating bootable media (the other being Rufus), with Etcher's main difference from Rufus being that it works across Windows macOS and Linux.

	- <https://github.com/balena-io/etcher>

	Supported OS's:

    - Linux; most distros; Intel 64-bit.
    - Windows 10 and later; Intel 64-bit.
    - macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) and later; both Intel and Apple Silicon.


??? info "Rufus"

	> Rufus is a utility that helps format and create bootable USB flash drives.

	Rufus is possibly the best imaging utility if you're on Windows, allowing you to not only flash external media with any image file you have available, but with the options to customize Windows images during the process. All features are [listed in the README](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus#features).

	- <https://github.com/pbatard/rufus>

	Rufus also has [extensive documentation on its security model](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/wiki/Security), from how it does what it does, to verifying signatures and how this works in Windows world, in a way that is useful and meaningful to a user. The concepts are not exclusive to Rufus.

??? example "etl2pcapng"

	> This tool enables you to view ndiscap and pktmon packet captures with Wireshark. Due to performance problems with the other popular packet capture method (WinPcap, which was included with older versions of Wireshark), these inbox tools should be preferred.

	- <https://github.com/microsoft/etl2pcapng>

	Here's how you can use this, taken from the README:

	> "pktmon" is implemented as an integral part of the Windows operating system. It's capable of capturing packets in many components of the operating system, giving full visibility into the life of the packet as it traverses the system. A capture can be collected with:
	>
	> ```cmd
	> pktmon start --capture
	> <repro>
	> pktmon stop
	> ```
	>
	> "ndiscap" which is implemented as an ETW trace provider. A capture can be collected with:
	>
	> ```cmd
	> netsh trace start capture=yes report=disabled
	> <repro>
	> netsh trace stop
	> ```


## :material-note-text: Note Taking

The best advice I've heard about note taking is 1) it should work for you, and 2) it should export to a common format like Markdown so you can move to another notes platform easily. This can be multiple apps, or just one. It's whatever works best for you and the goals you have.

??? note "Standard-Notes"

	> Standard Notes is an end-to-end encrypted note-taking app for digitalists and professionals. Capture your notes, files, and life's work all in one secure place.

	It works across all major platforms, desktop and web, using end-to-end encrypted syncing through their servers to all of your devices. Robust markdown formatting, a secrets vault, and even limited spreadsheet capability for paid subscriptions. Standard Notes is one of the most security and privacy focused of the various note taking applications, making efforts to function similar to a password manager with how it handles memory and data on-device.

	You could also self-host the client and server components, using tailscale to safely access it from your endpoints.

	- <https://standardnotes.com/>
	- <https://github.com/standardnotes/app>
	- License: AGPL-3.0

??? note "Obsidian"

	Perhaps the most popular notes application for infosec professionals and developers (as of the time of writing this). Obsidian features robust note taking and visualization capabilities through linking notes and creating a graph of how they relate. It works using markdown files saved to your device. Paid plans include end-to-end encrypted note sync.

	- <https://obsidian.md/>
	- <https://github.com/obsidianmd>

??? note "Joplin"

	> Joplin is a free, open source note taking and to-do application, which can handle a large number of notes organised into notebooks. The notes are searchable, can be copied, tagged and modified either from the applications directly or from your own text editor. The notes are in Markdown format. The notes can be securely synchronised using end-to-end encryption with various cloud services including Nextcloud, Dropbox, OneDrive and Joplin Cloud.

	This application is often referenced in relation to note taking for pentesting courses and certifications. It's fairly easy to install and functions entirely offline by default.

	- <https://github.com/laurent22/joplin>
	- License: AGPL-3.0-or-later

??? note "Notion"

	Notion is a note taking platform. Desktop apps are available but you can use it entirely through the web application. It is possibly the most feature-rich note taking platform available. If your subscription includes the AI component, it's practical and immediately usable out of the box.

	These notes are not end-to-end encrypted, and may not be the best option without an enterprise subscription if your notes include customer data.

	- <https://www.notion.com/>

??? note "Cherrytree"

	> A hierarchical note taking application, featuring rich text and syntax highlighting, storing data in either a single file (xml or sqlite) or multiple files and directories.

	This is often available by default in Kali Linux and frequently referenced in relation to note taking for pentesting courses and certifications.

	Primarily supports Windows and Linux (snap and flatpaks are available too).

	> Rocky Linux is an open-source enterprise operating system designed to be 100% bug-for-bug compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Rocky Linux is under intensive development by the community.

	- <https://rockylinux.org/>
	- <https://docs.rockylinux.org/> (The documentation is very straight forward and easy to understand, if you're learning Fedora or RHEL start here)

	Brief history about Rocky Linux:

	> On December 8, 2020, Red Hat announced that they would discontinue development of CentOS, which has been a production-ready downstream version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, in favor of a newer upstream development variant of that operating system known as "CentOS Stream". In response, the original founder of CentOS, Gregory Kurtzer, announced via a comment on the CentOS website that he would again start a project to achieve the original goals of CentOS. Its name was chosen as a tribute to early CentOS co-founder Rocky McGaugh. By December 12, the code repository of Rocky Linux had become the top-trending repository on GitHub.

	**Verifying Signatures**

	Interestingly the way to verify the ISO hashes is through this git repo, where the commits of the hashes are signed. This is because Keykeeper (part of the peridot build system) does not sign arbitrary files or artifacts outside of the build system. So rather than having a CHECKSUMS and a detached CHECKSUMS.sig, hashes are commited here by the maintainers.

	> openmediavault is the next generation network attached storage (NAS) solution based on Debian Linux. It contains services like SSH, (S)FTP, SMB/CIFS, RSync and many more. Thanks to the modular design of the framework it can be enhanced via plugins. openmediavault is primarily designed to be used in home environments or small home offices, but is not limited to those scenarios. It is a simple and easy to use out-of-the-box solution that will allow everyone to install and administrate a Network Attached Storage without deeper knowledge.
	>
	> Note: openmediavault (like other NAS solutions) expects to have full, exclusive control over OS configuration and cannot be used within a container. Also, no graphical desktop user interface can be installed in parallel.

## :material-server-network: Hypervisors

??? example "Proxmox"

	Proxmox is a complete open-source platform for virtualization. Built on Debian, it uses a web frontend to manage VM's and containers. You can install and use GUI and headless VM's, as well as manage and work with the underlying OS from a shell. For example it's entirely possible to install an EDR agent onto Proxmox, since it's Debian under the hood.

	- <https://www.proxmox.com/en/>
	- <https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/>

	The ISO URL points to an /iso/ folder on the Proxmox webiste. Browsing this manually reveals the following files:

	<https://enterprise.proxmox.com/iso/SHA256SUMS.txt>
	<https://enterprise.proxmox.com/iso/SHA256SUMS.asc>

	You can use these along with the following public key to verify the ISO's integrity.

	```bash
	gpg --keyserver hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com:443 --recv-keys 'F4E136C67CDCE41AE6DE6FC81140AF8F639E0C39'

??? example "VirtualBox"

	VirtualBox is often available in the default Linux repositories, but the **latest supported and patched** version is available directly from VirtualBox's offical repo.

	> VirtualBox is a general-purpose full virtualization software for x86_64 hardware (with version 7.1 additionally for macOS/Arm), targeted at laptop, desktop, server and embedded use.

	It works on Windows, macOS, Linux, and more. You'll also want the VirtualBox Extension Pack if you require USB pass-through or any other advanced features. It's free for personal use and is under a separate license agreement.

	```

??? example "QEMU"

	QEMU is available through your Linux distro's default package repos, and macOS's Homebrew / MacPorts. This is the recommended way to install it.

	QEMU could be thought of as the Hyper-V of Linux. It benefits from the KVM acceleration on Linux making the performance incredible, and in some sense is the most ubiquitously supported hypervisor across the distros, likely because of the KVM integration. You'll see this on Ubuntu where `apt` now checks to see if QEMU VM's are running.

	This is just my opinion and experience after moving to Hyper-V and QEMU from VMWare and VirtualBox. QEMU is also being used by Proxmox, which is another benefit to building and understanding QEMU images if you're using QEMU for desktop use cases and Proxmox as a virtualization server.

	> The purpose of this tool is to give pentesters a vulnerable Active directory environment ready to use to practice usual attack techniques. The idea behind this project is to give you an environment where you can try and train your pentest skills without having the pain to build all by yourself. This repository was build for pentest practice.

	Effectively, this can spin up really fast (as quick as a couple hours) on a Kali Linux host running VirtualBox as the Hypervisor. There's also a Proxmox option, but for this you may want to look at Ludus below.

	It goes without saying you need a fair amount of resources to run this, and it will be extremely expensive in the cloud.

	- [Open Community and Resource Hub for Open Source Managers and OSPO Practitioners](https://github.com/todogroup) (found via [licensee](https://github.com/licensee/licensee))

	**licensee**

	GitHub uses [licensee](https://github.com/licensee/licensee) to detect a repo license. [This page](https://github.com/licensee/licensee/blob/master/docs/what-we-look-at.md) details what licensee looks at to determine the repo license.

	**SPDX License Identifiers**

	The [SPDX license guidance](https://spdx.dev/learn/handling-license-info/) is the easiest way to note what license(s) each file falls under in your project.

	> In each file in your project, just add a single line in the following format, tailored to your license(s) and the comment style for that file's language:

??? example "debos"

	> debos is a tool to make the creation of various Debian-based OS images simpler. While most other tools focus on specific use-cases, debos is designed to be a toolchain making common actions trivial while providing enough rope to do whatever tweaking which might be required behind the scenes.
	>
	> debos expects a YAML file as input and runs the actions listed in the file sequentially. These actions should be self-contained and independent of each other.

### :simple-git: Git

??? example "Git Submodules"

	Submodules allow you to integrate a separate project into another using git. The project included as a submodule becomes version pinned to the commit at the point-in-time it was integrated. It's effectively a nested git repo within what becomes your "superproject", and can be pulled + updated to stay in sync with the submodule's repo. This is easy to do and helps you avoid duplicating work by reusing existing code.

	- <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules>

	To add a submodule to a repo:

	```bash
	# <submodule-name> can be specified as an option, if you want to change it
	# Otherwise the repo name is used by default
	git submodule add <repo-url> [<submodule-name>]
	```

	This creates the following `.gitmodules` file in the root of your repo:

	```yaml
	[submodule "<submodule-name>"]
        path = <submodule-name>
        url = <repo-url>
	```

	You can manually edit and revise these files.

	> There is a `foreach` submodule command to run some arbitrary command in each submodule. This can be really helpful if you have a number of submodules in the same project.

	```bash
	# Update all submodules in a repo
	git submodule foreach 'git pull'
	```


### :simple-github: GitHub

### :material-ansible: Ansible

!!! abstract "Ansible"

	Most of my Ansible notes are a part of the README over at my [straysheep-dev/ansible-configs](https://github.com/straysheep-dev/ansible-configs) repo.

	With that said, the most general and useful notes or links can be found here.

	- [Ansible GitHub](https://github.com/ansible/ansible)
	- [Installing `ansible`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/index.html)
	- [Installing `anisble-lint`](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/lint/installing/)
	- [`ansible-lint` Rules](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/lint/rules/)

??? example "Ansible-Galaxy"

	This is the suggested way to share and run roles or collections. Though you ***can*** run them using local paths, you're meant to reference them using a fully-qualified-name (FQN in Ansible terms).

	- [Ansible-Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/)
	- [Ansible-Galaxy User Guide (`ansible-galaxy`)](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/galaxy/user_guide.html)

	- [Role Naming Conventions](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/developing_collections_structure.html#roles-directory)


	When creating roles that will be published, you'll need to fill out the `meta.yml` details:

	- [Role Meta: Supported Platforms (GH Issue: 52)](https://github.com/ansible/galaxy/issues/52)
	- [Role Meta: Supported Platforms (`ansible-lint` schema)](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lint/blob/main/src/ansiblelint/schemas/meta.json)

	The documentation (at the time of writing) suggested making an `~/.ansible.cfg` to target the beta galaxy_ng server, however this is no longer working (in other words, the galaxy_ng server is no longer in beta and is now the default). It seems the best way to do this is by providing your API key on the command line, through an environment variable:

	```bash
	echo "Enter Galaxy API Token"; read -r -s ansible_galaxy_token; export ANSIBLE_GALAXY_TOKEN=$ansible_galaxy_token
	# [type or paste your key, it won't echo or show up in your bash history]
	ansible-galaxy role import -vvv --token $ANSIBLE_GALAXY_TOKEN <github-username> <ansible-role-my_repo>
	```

	The above command will add (import) a role from your GitHub, to your own Ansible-Galaxy namespace, so that others can download and install it directly from the `ansible-galaxy` command.

??? example "Molecule"

	> Molecule aids in the development and testing of Ansible content: collections, playbooks and roles.

??? example "Packer"

	> Packer is a tool that lets you create identical machine images for multiple platforms from a single source template. Packer can create golden images to use in image pipelines.

	- <https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer>

	Packer literally builds virtual machines images. Think of installing Kali or Windows from the ISO manually in VMware, Hyper-V, VirtualBox, QEMU, or anywhere else (supported by packer). Packer actually automates those steps, even down to the boot key presses so you can build and configure a VM with zero interaction. You can see this happen in real time if you aren't running packer in headless mode. The VM GUI window will open as if you were doing the install yourself, and you can watch it run.

	To really utilize packer, you'll need to learn and implemenet (depending on the OS and technology available) cloud-init, autoinstall, preseed, or similar auto-provisioning mechanisms so you don't have to manually intervene.

	You can also post-process the install with additional shell commands, scripts, Ansible playbooks, and more.

	The resulting images can be imported into a hypervisor, sent to a cloud provider as the disk image for a cloud VM, or converted into a Vagrant box image.

!!! abstract "PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard)"

	The PTES is a standard first drafted in 2009. It's designed to provide both businesses and security service providers with a common language and scope for performing penetration testing. It's been referenced in a number of training courses and by those who helped create it over the years. [The FAQ provides additonal overview](https://github.com/OpenSBK/ptes/blob/main/faq.md).

	Kevin Johnson (SecureIdeas, OpenSBK) was on [Paul's Security Weekly #785](https://securityweekly.com/psw-785) to talk about this updated version of the PTES, now on GitHub for others to contribute to. It was mentioned again in [SWN-453](https://securityweekly.com/swn-453), where one of OpenSBK's goals in addition to updating the PTES will be defining the language used in InfoSec.

!!! quote "Unified Entity Context"

	[Unified Entity Context: The AI Stack Everyone is Building Without Realizing It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHUqk90ch7I)

	This was discussed as one piece of another episode of Unsupervised Learning by Daniel Miessler. The gist of the episode is AI with a complete context of information, which includes accuracy, understanding of stale or historical information, having access to current information, organizational goals, and more, leads to a world where decision making and understanding isn't splintered and siloed by front ends, platforms, or databases. It's effectively central to an organization with RBAC handled through identity. While all data "lives" in a central location, this removal of silos and handling of access maintains security while improving decision making and understanding by those interacting with the data.

	The highlight though is **the approach to a security assessment** that was discussed.

	Ask these questions to each "layer" of an organization, starting with the C-suite:

	- What is the core function of the business?
	- What are the company's goals?
	- Where is input and output data flowing?

	Use the answers to build a visual map, to illustrate what the company really looks like:

	- Data flow and storage
	- Vendors
	- Who is accessing what
	- What should and should not be in this map

	This creates the context or foundation for you to begin any assessment by revealing areas to focus on you would otherwise not know about without this context.

	- [LOLBAS](https://lolbas-project.github.io/) details these kinds of bypasses
	- Electron applications are interesting targets
		- They're the reverse of EXE / DLL's in that the Electron EXE exposes API's to .js files and .node modules
		- Goal is to execute arbitrary JS and leverage existing Node modules through a trusted Electron application
		- Electron apps can enforce integrity checking on JS scripts they execute which can help mitigate this vector
	- Node modules have limitations, but can be stealthier
		- Largely undocumented internal structures
		- If you use a function of a signed Node module instead of PowerShell, you avoid spawning processes and being caught
		- Execute everything in JS to remain stealthier

	- Use Azure WebApps to deliver the payload through a ClickOnce dialogue, on a "trusted" domain
	- This is the same style of prompt you get when opening application links in the browser
	- Effectiveness depends on the ruse / social engineering / circumstance
	- The app is a signed ssh / sshd package in .NET
	- It's designed and embedded with the key material to connect back to your own server
	- The connection does not allow command execution
	- The connecting user has no shell `sudo useradd -m -s /usr/sbin/nologin clientnameuser`
	- The attacker gains a full SOCKS proxy through the endpoint
	- This may not look entirely malicious to some tools

	- Look at networked processes on endpoints
	- Inspecting protocols on ALL ports
	- Inspecting code signatures on binaries
	- Preventing execution of unauthorized applications

### :material-server-security: Security Platforms

!!! abstract "Why Platforms?"

	This sections covers what I would call "Security Platforms". This is intentionally generic, and meant to be a catch-all for the security "things" out there that are not a single-purpose tool, framework, or a solution specific to any system.

	This section may be broken down later, but for now it includes everything from XDR, SIEM, and AppSec solutions to vulnerability scanners and monitoring platforms.

??? example "wazuh"

	wazuh is a fully open source XDR and SIEM. It's very easy to setup and use, supporting deployment on a number of endpoints. Anything it can't deploy an agent on can ship logs to a central log server that can be ingested later by wazuh.

	- <https://wazuh.com/>
	- <https://github.com/wazuh>

	Overview:

	- SIEM / Log analysis
	- EDR
	- File integrity monitoring
	- Vulnerability detection
	- Configuration assessment

	One drawback to wazuh is that the agent is a regular system process and not a kernel-level process. Ideally you would be catching something before it reaches the kernel and evades detection, but this is what some may consider its weakness compared to other XDR solutions.

### :simple-linux: Linux

??? tip "Kernel Lockdown Mode"

	You can set the Linux kernel to lockdown mode by enabling Secure Boot, or by setting the mode manually in GRUB.

	- <https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/security/lockdown/Kconfig>
	- [manpages: kernel_lockdown](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hirsute/man7/kernel_lockdown.7.html)

	What this does:

	- Modifications to the kernel at runtime will require a reboot
	- Makes an attacker's job more difficult at gaining kernel level persistence or escaping the hypervisor. (Stops a number of known rootkits)
	- Disabling Secure Boot at the UEFI level requires physical or serial console access for MOK in the firmware during the boot process

	How this can be defeated:

	- If signing scripts and keys are present on the system at the time of compromise
	- Novel attack against the Linux kernel

	How this can be detected:

	- [Monitor and log root command execution with auditd](https://github.com/Neo23x0/auditd) or [Sysmon](https://github.com/Sysinternals/SysmonForLinux)
	- Watch invokation of `/usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r)/scripts/sign-file` and `mokutil`
	- If you did not schedule a shutdown or reboot that occured, you may have been compromised.

	>                         confidentiality, kernel features that allow userland
	>                         to extract confidential information from the kernel
	>                         are also disabled.


	Configuring Lockdown Mode:

	- `lockdown=integrity` is enabled by default on systems with UEFI Secure Boot
	- **The recommended way of making persistent kernel-command-line modifications is via GRUB/GRUB2**
	- This is done with `grub` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `grubby` (RHEL/Fedora) via the boot parameters.

	Get the current lockdown setting:

	```bash
	cat /sys/kernel/security/lockdown
	```

	**Setting Lockdown Mode on Debian/Ubuntu or Fedora/RHEL**

	```bash
	sudo nano /etc/default/grub
	```

	Change `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=""` to have `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="lockdown=<mode>"` *appended* (if there are already other CMDLINE parameters).

	Mode can be one of `none`, `integrity`, or `confidentiality`

	EXAMPLE: `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="lockdown=integrity"`

	After making any changes:

	```bash
	# Debian / Ubuntu
	sudo update-grub

	# Fedora / RHEL
	sudo grub2-mkconfig > /dev/null
	```

	**Setting Lockdown Mode on Raspberry Pi**

	This file points to all of the boot parameters, typically in the same directory:

	```txt
	/boot/firmware/config.txt
	```

	To modify a kernel command line parameter as you would in /etc/default/grub:

	```bash
	sudo echo 'lockdown=confidentiality' >> /boot/firmware/nobtcmd.txt
	```

	**All Distros**

	No matter which Linux distribution you're making these changes on, to complete the process you'll need to reboot.

	```bash
	# Reboot after making changes
	sudo systemctl reboot
	```

	To verify the changes on reboot:

	```bash
	cat /sys/kernel/security/lockdown
	none [integrity] confidentiality
	```

??? bug "RITA"

	> Real Intelligence Threat Analytics (RITA) is a framework for detecting command and control communication through network traffic analysis.

	- <https://github.com/activecm/rita>

	RITA is possibly the ultimate open-source network threat hunting tool. Using Zeek logs, it can determine:

    > - Beaconing Detection: Search for signs of beaconing behavior in and out of your network
    > - Long Connection Detection: Easily see connections that have communicated for long periods of time
    > - DNS Tunneling Detection: Search for signs of DNS based covert channels
    > - Threat Intel Feed Checking: Query threat intel feeds to search for suspicious domains and hosts

	The deployment method has changed since they have moved to using Ansible. It can be dropped onto the local system with:

	```bash
	./install_rita.sh "localhost"
	```

	Or one-or-more remote systems by passing a comma-separated list of endpoints to the installer like this:

	```bash
	./install_rita.sh "root@<ip_1>,<ip_2>,myhost.internal"
	```

	A RITA "server" can ingest Zeek logs into multiple data sets, either on a recurring / rolling basis as part of a crontask or as needed into unique data sets. This means you can continue to add to specific data sets and perform analysis of specific networks over time.


??? danger "Zeek"

	> Zeek is a powerful network analysis framework that is much different from the typical IDS you may know.

	- <https://zeek.org/>
	- <https://github.com/zeek/zeek>

	Zeek is the tool you'll want to use to create the necessary logs to ingest with RITA for network threat hunting. Zeek itself doesn't need to be running on every endpoint, you can simply write and log packet captures of network activity using something like `netsh`, `pktmon`, `tshark` or `tcpdump` to be sent to a central logging server where Zeek can transform those captures into Zeek logs.

	If you're using the built-in Windows `netsh` and `pktmon` tools, you'll likely need to convert the capture files into pcaps with [etl2pcapng](https://github.com/microsoft/etl2pcapng).

	[NPM Attack Leveraging Unicode Steganography and Google Calendar C2](https://www.veracode.com/resources/sophisticated-npm-attack-leveraging-unicode-steganography-and-google-calendar-c2/)

	Check the screenshot of the hexdump, the many dots following the `|` character are the obfuscated glyphs carrying the base64 data in their low byte. This is only a small piece of this research, but the invisible unicode characters are likely the most interesting part.

	The research does the best job of unwinding this, but essentially:

	- A .js file had a decode()-to-eval() happening on (what seems like) a single `|` character, which makes no sense at first glance
	- The [Variation Selectors Supplement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variation_Selectors_Supplement) range (U+E0100 to U+E01EF) was used to hide base64 data
	- This provides 240 possible characters, base64 only requires 64 characters `[A-Za-z0-9+/]` with `=` for padding
	- These characters have no "glyph", and are therefore *invisible*
	- The key here is `xx` in `U+E01xx`, which remember the available range is U+E0100 to U+E01EF, offered enough space and variation to store valid base64 data
	- This is only "visible" by hexdumping the .js file

	**Demo**

	The easiest way to visualize this is using the [`chr()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#chr) function in python:

	```python3
	# Prints the copyright symbol
	print(chr(0x00A9))

	# Prints one of these invisible glyphs
	print(chr(0xE0100))
	```

	**Detection**

	- Line length
	- Hexdump
	- Changing `eval()` to `console.log()`

	Despite how awesome this technique is, it eventually has to decode itself to plaintext to execute. This will likely appear in some type of log or network capture.

	A few points based on the show notes and the article:

	- If Microsoft doesn't update the DBX or SBAT to prevent loading these versions of GRUB, you can use a vulnerable version of GRUB via USB boot to bypass Secure Boot
	- This potentially allows USB-based boot attacks to bypass GPG signed boot, GRUB passwords, and possibly full disk encryption
	- Also includes a vulnerability similar to [LogoFAIL](https://www.binarly.io/blog/the-far-reaching-consequences-of-logofail), exploiting image parsers


## :material-magnify: Forensics

??? question "uac (Unix-like Artifacts Collector)"

	> UAC is a Live Response collection script for Incident Response that makes use of native binaries and tools to automate the collection of AIX, ESXi, FreeBSD, Linux, macOS, NetBSD, NetScaler, OpenBSD and Solaris systems artifacts. It was created to facilitate and speed up data collection, and depend less on remote support during incident response engagements.

	- <https://github.com/tclahr/uac>

	UAC is primarily an **evidence collection tool**. This isn't something like [linpeas](https://github.com/peass-ng/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS) that will alert you to possible leads as it's gathering evidence. It's a ton of output, and is a haystack in which you'd be trying to find a very small needle if you didn't already have an idea of what you're looking for. With this in mind, there are a few effective ideas on how to leverage this tool:

	- Assume you're compromised, hit each endpoint with UAC and pull the resulting evidence back to your IR machine
	- Investigate supsicious activity with system internals, using what you know while UAC runs
	- Use [linpeas](https://github.com/peass-ng/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS) to assess endpoints, it's not just a hacking tool, it will find IOC's

	If you have a possible lead or IOC, then your UAC evidence becomes invaluable. With the evidence back on your IR machine:

	- You can of course dig into specific evidence based on your potential IOC's
	- You could also use **[YARA](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara)** to hit the entire UAC evidence folder for IOC's, which is incredibly fast

	Trezor is a physical hardware wallet for cryptocurrency. These devices also have other functionality, such as U2F, FIDO, and WebAuth.

	- <https://trezor.io/>
	- <https://docs.trezor.io/>

	The easiest way to use a Trezor hardware wallet is through the Trezor Suite. Download the Trezor suite AppImage (recommended) and check the signatures:

	- <https://github.com/trezor/trezor-suite/releases>
	- Trezor [signing key via trezor.io](https://trezor.io/security/satoshilabs-2021-signing-key.asc)
	- Trezor [signing key on the Ubuntu Keyserver](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?search=EB483B26B078A4AA1B6F425EE21B6950A2ECB65C&fingerprint=on&op=index)

	```
	pub   rsa4096/0xE21B6950A2ECB65C 2021-01-04 [SC]
		Key fingerprint = EB48 3B26 B078 A4AA 1B6F  425E E21B 6950 A2EC B65C
	uid                             SatoshiLabs 2021 Signing Key
	```

	Or access the web version here:

	- <https://suite.trezor.io/web>
	- Chrome (web-USB or `trezord`) or Firefox only
	- `trezord` is a local daemon that was required when only the web version existed

	Install udev rules for the hardware wallet's usb connection: [51-trezor.rules](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-suite/blob/develop/packages/suite-data/files/bin/udev/51-trezor.rules)

	```bash
	sudo cp 51-trezor.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
	sudo udevadm control --reload
	```

	For reference, Yubico's udev rules with Trezor are here: [70-u2f.rules](https://github.com/Yubico/libu2f-host/blob/master/70-u2f.rules)

	Next, you'll likely need to install the previous FUSE binaries.

	- <https://github.com/appimage/appimagekit/wiki/fuse>

	```bash
	sudo add-apt-repository universe

	# 24.04 and later
	sudo apt install libfuse2t64

	# 22.04 and earlier
	sudo apt install fuse libfuse2

	sudo modprobe fuse
	sudo groupadd fuse

	user="$(whoami)"
	sudo usermod -a -G fuse $user

	sudo systemctl reboot
	```

	If you have usbguard running, when updating the Trezor wallet's firmware, you'll need to "add" it again in the policy list. When the device reboots into bootloader mode for updates, its characteristics change. To usbguard this is a different device.

	```bash
	usbguard list-devices
	sudo usbguard allow-device <id> -p
	```

### :octicons-tools-16: Tools

??? example "ollama"

	> Get up and running with Llama 3.3, DeepSeek-R1, Phi-4, Gemma 3, Mistral Small 3.1 and other large language models.

	- <https://github.com/ollama/ollama>
	- <https://ollama.com/>
	- [Documentation](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/tree/main/docs)

	ollama was showcased in [Keeping Things Local - Making Your Own Private LLM w/ Bronwen Aker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbzkJRl_xnk). It's incredibly easy to get started, and have a local LLM running without a ton of resources.

	Think of ollama as a CLI frontend with access to a repo of vetted LLM's. This is different from Hugging Face, which is not a frontend, but is more like GitHub (the wild west).

	Essentially, you can download and run models, customize them fairly quickly and easily using files similar to [Daniel Miessler's fabric patterns](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/tree/main/patterns), and through RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) contextualize them around a local set of files or data.

	All of this was learned from Bronwen's presentation.

??? quote "Keeping Things Local - Making Your Own Private LLM w/ Bronwen Aker"

	- <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbzkJRl_xnk>
	- [Slides](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SLIDES_Keeping-Things-Local-BHIS-webcast-2025.04.03.pdf)

	This is a full walkthrough of how to do this yourself, put together by Bronwen over at [BHIS](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/blog/). It's straight forward and easy to understand if you're looking to get started with local LLM's.

	- ollama is essentially a frontend to interface with and retrieve vetted LLM's
	- Hugging Face is more like GitHub, and not every model is vetted, however official models from trusted sources are available there as well
	- The resoure requirements aren't high, WSL can run these too since Windows passes the GPU through
	- It's easy to customize a model
	- RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) is the process of referencing documents and data without re-training a model (which is expensive and hard)

??? example "fabric"

	> fabric is an open-source framework for augmenting humans using AI. It provides a modular framework for solving specific problems using a crowdsourced set of AI prompts that can be used anywhere.

	- <https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric>
	- [Patterns](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/tree/main/patterns)

	The pattern files are raw markdown that provide context to each query you make.

	The [Keeping Things Local - Making Your Own Private LLM w/ Bronwen Aker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbzkJRl_xnk) demo was a reminder of this. It works not only with external API-based services, but also local LLM's.


??? example "Google Gemini"

	- <https://gemini.google.com>
	- [Gemini Apps Privacy Hub](https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/13594961)

	If you don't want your input and output to be used for training or human review, you can turn off Gemini Apps Activity. This does not delete past data. As with any AI assume any inputs or outputs may become public or used for training.

	Gemini is usable within Google Workspace. According to their policy it will not share or train on input or output of emails, documents, or otherwise unless you decide to allow that.

	Other interesting features include:

	- NotebookLM: Process text, PDFs, Google Docs, websites, and more into summaries that include a podcast-like audio conversation about the content
	- [Sec-Gemini](https://security.googleblog.com/2025/04/google-launches-sec-gemini-v1-new.html) is built to augment SOC workflows with Mandiant and OSV data

??? example "OpenAI"

	Possibly the most popular general-use AI. It's capable of text and audio conversation, coding, image and video generation and editing. There's also web search, deep research, and scheduled tasks.

	- <https://openai.com/>
	- <https://chatgpt.com/>
	- <https://sora.com/>

	If you don't want your input and output to be used for training or shared to the explore feed in Sora, you can turn this off in the settings of both ChatGPT and Sora, where they're on by default. As with any AI assume any inputs or outputs may become public or used for training.

??? example "Cloudflare: AI Labyrinth"

	> ...we decided to use a new offensive tool in the bot creator's toolset that we haven't really seen used defensively: AI-generated content. When we detect unauthorized crawling, rather than blocking the request, we will link to a series of AI-generated pages that are convincing enough to entice a crawler to traverse them. But while real looking, this content is not actually the content of the site we are protecting, so the crawler wastes time and resources.
	>
	> As an added benefit, AI Labyrinth also acts as a next-generation honeypot. No real human would go four links deep into a maze of AI-generated nonsense. Any visitor that does is very likely to be a bot, so this gives us a brand-new tool to identify and fingerprint bad bots, which we add to our list of known bad actors. Here's how we do it...

### :material-lightning-bolt-circle: Attacks

??? danger "The Policy Puppetry Attack"

	> The attacks in this blog leverage the Policy Puppetry Attack, a novel prompt attack technique created by HiddenLayer researchers. By reformulating prompts to look like one of a few types of policy files, such as XML, INI, or JSON, an LLM can be tricked into subverting alignments or instructions. As a result, attackers can easily bypass system prompts and any safety alignments trained into the models. Instructions do not need to be in any particular policy language. However, the prompt must be written in a way that the target LLM can interpret as policy. To further improve the attack's strength, extra sections that control output format and/or override specific instructions given to the LLM in its system prompt can be added.
