# :material-book-open-page-variant-outline: About

Information, compiled for easy reference. This section has longer form write-ups, guides, research, and more. Navigate over to the [resources](../resources.md) tab if you're just looking for external references in general.

!!! abstract "CI/CD Your Notes"

    This set of links and notes has been my longest running note file, originally started back in CherryTree before making its way to this page.

    The idea has been to create a searchable location pointing to each of these things, sorted by category, and with notes around them. This is currently a work in progess as entries need to be reformatted and updated as they move from my notes onto this page.

!!! warning "AI Usage"

	AI was used to port some of my existing notes out of CherryTree and Standard-Notes, by converting the original markdown formatting I had into the formatting I decided on for mkdocs-material. This choice was made due to volume as well as format inconsistencies across years of previous notes.
